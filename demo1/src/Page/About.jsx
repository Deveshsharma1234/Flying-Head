            This React.js project houses a clean, minimalist user interface for exploring and accessing APIs. 
            As a software developer looking for more things to build, I made this collection to easily discover 
            new project ideas and sources of content. And in doing so, I've strived for simple design, accessibility, 
            and intuitive use â€“ because that's what the best things are.

        <p className="mt-4">
            Free APIs is organized by two main modes: a general view of all APIs and a targeted, category-specific approach. 
            There are further options to search, sort, shuffle, and reset the API cards. Each card links to its respective API.
